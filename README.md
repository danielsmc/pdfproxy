## Motivation

Finally, a chance show Aunt Gladys what "that awful internet" would be like if it was easier to read. Like a book! Or maybe a newspaper! Your grandfather, god rest his soul, loved reading those!

After unearthing a copy of VaporSoft's DocuOSâ„¢ and getting it to run in a browser, we we were able to take advantage of the PDF file format's unique properties and place the internet in a PDF for you to use! Unfortunately, the way the technology works means that you have to [supply the initial URL yourself](URL).
